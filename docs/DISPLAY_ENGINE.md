# KramFlow Display Engine

A centralized real-time display subsystem covering the Presenter Confidence
Monitor, and the Green Room / AV / General displays. Originally built as an
additive, flag-gated preview subsystem alongside the pre-existing app; since
consolidated into the canonical implementation of those surfaces — see
"History" below.

## Design intent

Long-distance readability, huge typography, a single confidence-monitor
mental model applied consistently across display types — inspired by the
*usability principles* of tools like StageTimer (countdown/count-up,
overtime awareness, fullscreen, distraction-free), not their interface.
Nothing here reuses StageTimer's layout, colors, or branding; it follows
KramFlow's own design tokens (`app/globals.css`) and the same "one accent
color, no gradients, no decorative motion" discipline as the rest of the
app, with one documented exception (see [Timer colors](#timer-colors)).

## History

This subsystem was originally built additively on a feature branch, kept
behind a `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISPLAY_ENGINE_ENABLED` build flag, and synced its own
state (registry, timer, Hold, Broadcasts, Speaker Ready) purely via
`BroadcastChannel` (same-browser only) or an optional self-hosted WebSocket
relay — built before Supabase existed in this project.

Two consolidation passes later:

1. **View consolidation** — the plain "original" AV and Green Room pages
   were deleted in favor of these richer ones (they already had every field
   the originals had, plus Hold/Broadcast/timer escalation/props/camera
   angle). Volunteer Board was dropped (not a wanted surface; its one
   distinguishing feature, `Program.team`, is dead data — always `null` in
   `lib/data/sessions.ts`). Routes were renamed to clean top-level paths
   (`/displays/av` → `/av`, etc. — see [Module map](#module-map)) and the
   feature flag was removed; these are permanent canonical routes now, not
   an experimental preview.
2. **Transport migration** — Hold, Timer, Speaker Ready, the display
   registry, and Broadcasts (active/scheduled/history) moved onto Supabase
   Postgres + Realtime, the same backbone `lib/store.tsx` already used for
   the core show data. This closed a real inconsistency: Next/Previous/
   Alert/Notes always synced across real devices; Hold/Broadcast did not,
   unless the separate WS relay was deployed. See
   [Real-time transport](#real-time-transport).

Program/session/live-state data is still never duplicated — every display
page reads the same `useEventStore()`, `useSessions()`,
`getLive()`/`getNext()`/`getOnDeck()` the Operator Dashboard uses.

## Real-time transport — two systems now, on purpose

- **Hold, Timer, Speaker Ready, the display registry, and Broadcasts
  (active/scheduled/history)** sync via **Supabase Postgres + Realtime**
  (`supabase/schema.sql`'s `display_state`, `display_registry`,
  `display_broadcasts` tables), following the exact pattern
  `lib/store.tsx`/`lib/use-sessions.ts` already established: reads are a
  fetch + `postgres_changes` Realtime subscription
  (`lib/display-engine/store.tsx`'s `fetchRemoteSlice()`/
  `ensureRemoteTransportConnected()`), writes go through
  `app/api/display-engine/*` routes using the service-role key. This is
  genuinely cross-device now — a phone and a lobby TV in different rooms
  see each other's Hold/Broadcast state without any extra infrastructure.
- **Profiles, Groups, and Broadcast templates/favorites/drafts** — operator
  UI configuration, not live show state — stay on `localStorage`, synced
  same-browser-only via `BroadcastChannel` (`lib/display-engine/transport.ts`,
  unchanged from before). Deliberately out of scope for the Supabase
  migration; each operator's browser has its own. The optional WebSocket
  relay (`scripts/display-engine-ws-server.mjs`) still exists and would
  extend this local-only slice across devices if ever needed, but nothing
  in this app requires it anymore.

### Auth boundary

Hold/Timer/Speaker-Ready/Registry-heartbeat write endpoints are
**intentionally public** (no PIN) — Presenter and Green Room are
unauthenticated pages today (no PIN gate on `/presenter`, `/green-room`,
`/av`, `/general`), so this matches the actual pre-existing risk level;
the Supabase migration changed *how* this state syncs, not *who* can
trigger it. Broadcast Center's send/schedule/cancel actions, and Display
Manager's rename/assign/command/remove actions, **are** PIN-gated
(`lib/server/require-auth.ts`) since those pages sit inside the
`(operator)` route group. Dismiss/acknowledge/promote-a-scheduled-broadcast
stay public too — `components/display-engine/broadcast-overlay.tsx`,
rendered on every public display, calls dismiss/acknowledge directly, and
the scheduled-broadcast poller runs in whichever tab happens to have the
store loaded, not just an authenticated one.

## Timer engine

`useDisplayTimer()` drives every timer-bearing display from one of two sources, selected by `engine.timer.source`:

- **Auto** — reads the *existing* app's live program (`durationMinutes`, `progress.startedAt`, `LiveState.pausedAt`). This is what "auto-follows the Operator Dashboard" means concretely: no separate program state, just the same numbers every other display already reads.
- **Manual** — the engine's own independent `TimerState` (now the `timer` column of the `display_state` singleton row), driven by the Presenter Display's controls (start/pause/resume/reset/±30s/±1min), using the identical shift-on-resume model as the main app's own Hold (`pausedAt` shifts `startedAt` forward by the paused duration on resume — computed server-side now in `app/api/display-engine/timer/route.ts`'s `resume` case).

### Timer colors

Green/orange/red reuse the exact hex values already in `app/globals.css`. **Yellow is new** — a confidence monitor needs a 5-step escalation (on-time → approaching end → final minute → overtime → critical/blinking) that the rest of the app's 4-color palette doesn't provide. This is the one deliberate, contrast-verified (9.85:1 against `#0F1115`) exception to "one accent color," scoped narrowly to `lib/display-engine/colors.ts` — no shared design token was touched.

### Session Timer mode — known simplification

The existing data model tracks *per-item* `startedAt` (`SessionProgress.startedAt`), not a separate "whole session start time." Session Timer mode therefore reuses the same elapsed-time math as Count-up mode, differentiated by label/framing only ("session elapsed" vs "elapsed"), not by genuinely different timer semantics. A true session-wide timer would need a new field on `LiveState` — out of scope for this pass since it would touch the existing, frozen data model.

## Hold Mode

`HoldState` (`activateHold`/`deactivateHold`, now backed by `app/api/display-engine/hold/route.ts` and the `display_state.hold` column) is a full-screen takeover (`HoldScreen`), independent of the timer, with five presets (`HOLD_PRESETS`) and an optional `continueClock` flag. Rendered above `BroadcastOverlay`'s banners (z-40 vs z-30) but below emergency broadcasts (z-50) — an active emergency is meant to interrupt even a Hold screen. The Presenter page's own control bar sits at `z-[45]`, above the Hold overlay, specifically so a real click can still release Hold once it's active — see the "4 real bugs" fix in git history for why this matters (the overlay used to fully occlude the only Hold toggle).

## Broadcast Center

`BroadcastMessage`/`BroadcastDraft` cover title/message/icon/priority/target/expiration/duration/acknowledgement/persistence, plus scheduling (below). Targeting (`targetMatchesDisplay()`) supports all/type/specific-display/group. Each display renders broadcasts itself via `<BroadcastOverlay>` — non-emergency messages stack as up-to-3 bottom banners (dismissible unless `persistent`), emergency messages take over the full screen and can require acknowledgement.

**Banners are rendered on an opaque `bg-card/95` + blur surface, not a translucent tint** — an earlier version used `bg-status-*/15`, which let page content (e.g. the Presenter Display's own footer) bleed through and visually collide with banner text in Program/Session mode. Caught during end-to-end browser testing; fixed by giving the banner container a solid backdrop and moving the type's accent color to just the icon chip.

### Scheduled broadcasts — known limitation (carried forward, not solved by the Supabase migration)

A scheduled broadcast (`display_broadcasts` row with `status = 'scheduled'`) is promoted to `status = 'sent'` by `app/api/display-engine/broadcasts/[id]/promote/route.ts`, called by a lightweight in-store scheduler (`ensureSchedulerRunning()`, polling every 5s) that runs inside whichever browser tab happens to have the Display Engine loaded. **There is still no server-side cron in this environment.** Moving the state to Supabase made the *result* of promotion genuinely cross-device (every display sees the promoted broadcast via Realtime), but the *trigger* is still "some open tab happened to notice" — a real fix would need Supabase `pg_cron` or a Vercel Cron Job calling the promote route on a schedule.

Recurrence (from the original spec's "schedule/recurrence") was **not implemented** — only one-shot future sends.

## Display Registry, Manager, and Profiles

Every display page calls `useRegisterDisplay(name, type, room, onCommand)` once: registers itself (now via `POST /api/display-engine/registry`, public), heartbeats every 15s with a latency sample, and applies+clears any `pendingCommand` the Display Manager issues (`test-message`, `force-fullscreen`, `reload`, delivered via `PATCH /api/display-engine/registry/[id]`, PIN-gated). A display is considered `offline` after 45s without a heartbeat (`OFFLINE_AFTER_MS`).

**Display Manager** (`/display-manager`, PIN-gated) lists every registered display with live status/latency — genuinely cross-device now, since the registry lives in `display_registry` rather than same-browser `localStorage` — with inline rename/type/room/profile assignment, and per-display actions:
- **Preview** — a real, live `<iframe>` of the display's actual route (same synced state, genuinely live).
- **Screenshot** — uses the browser's native `getDisplayMedia()` picker (the operator selects the window/screen to capture) and downloads a PNG. Unaffected by the transport migration — pure browser API.
- **Force Fullscreen / Test Message / Reload** — delivered via `sendCommand()` → the target's `pending_command` column, read back via Realtime.

**Display Profiles** (`profile-editor.tsx`, embedded in Display Manager) are full CRUD on top of `BUILT_IN_PROFILES` (Presenter/Minimal/AV/General/Green Room) — **stay local-only**, same as Groups. Built-in profiles are read-only; operators can create/edit/delete their own, then assign them to a display from the same list.

## Speaker Ready — new, narrowly-scoped state

The Green Room Display's "speaker ready" indicator has no equivalent in the existing `Program`/`LiveState` model — it's genuinely new information (has the next speaker checked in?), not derivable from anything already tracked. Lives in `display_state.speaker_ready` (a `Record<programId, boolean>` jsonb map), written via `PATCH /api/display-engine/speaker-ready` (public — Green Room's toggle is unauthenticated).

## General Display — pragmatic scoping

"Sponsor Slides" and "Directional Information" are scoped down to a static text section rather than a full slide/asset-management CMS, which would be a project of its own. "Countdown to Next Event" and "Daily Schedule" are real and live.

### `scheduledStart` is a display string, not a timestamp — a real bug found and fixed

`Program.scheduledStart` (from the cue sheet) is a pre-formatted string like `"5:00 PM"` — the existing app has only ever rendered it as plain text (`components/operator/program-list.tsx`). Three places in this subsystem initially called `new Date(scheduledStart)` / `Date.parse(scheduledStart)` on it, which is not a parseable format and silently produced `Invalid Date` (`session-timeline.tsx`, the Green Room "expected start" label, and the General display's countdown). Caught during end-to-end browser testing. Fixed by:
- Rendering the field as plain text everywhere except the one place a real countdown is required.
- Adding a narrow `parseTimeToday()` helper (General display page only) that parses the actual `"H:MM AM/PM"` format against *today's* date — a safe assumption for a display that only ever runs on the actual event day, same assumption the rest of the live-event tooling already makes.

## A real bug found in testing: stale `clientId` race

`useDisplayEngine()`'s `clientId` was a module-level variable only corrected (from the SSR `"server"` fallback to the real per-tab id) inside `ensureTransportConnected()`, which runs post-commit via `useSyncExternalStore`'s `subscribe()`. A fast-firing effect (`useRegisterDisplay`'s registration effect) could run before that correction landed, registering a bogus `"server"` entry in the shared display registry. Fixed by resolving `clientId` eagerly at module init (`typeof window !== "undefined" ? readClientId() : "server"`) instead of waiting for `subscribe()` — verified fixed by clearing state and re-registering, confirming exactly one clean entry.

## Keyboard shortcuts (Presenter Display)

`Space` pause/resume · `+`/`-` adjust 30s · `R` reset · `F` fullscreen toggle · `H` hold toggle · `Esc` exit fullscreen. Scoped per-page via `useKeyboardShortcuts()`, ignored while an `<input>`/`<textarea>` has focus, never attached globally.

## Session persistence & reconnection

Hold/Timer/Speaker-Ready/Registry/Broadcasts rehydrate from Supabase on load (a fetch, then Realtime keeps them current) — a refreshed display picks up exactly where the shared state left off regardless of which device refreshed. The local-only slice (Profiles/Groups/templates/favorites/drafts) still rehydrates from `localStorage` as before. `useFullscreen()` remembers the fullscreen preference across reloads (browsers only allow *entering* fullscreen from a real user gesture, so a refreshed display can't silently re-enter it, but the preference is available for an operator to act on).

## Known constraints

- **Framer Motion over `styled-jsx`** — `AGENTS.md` warns this Next.js version has unverified/changed APIs; the TimerRing's blink and the HoldScreen's fade both use Framer Motion (already a project dependency) rather than risk `styled-jsx`.
- **No new runtime dependencies** — the WS relay is hand-rolled specifically to avoid adding `ws` to `package.json` for what is now genuinely optional infrastructure (only relevant to the local-only Profiles/Groups slice, if ever needed cross-device).
